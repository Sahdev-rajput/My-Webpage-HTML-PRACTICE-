# My-Webpage-HTML-PRACTICE-
This was my first website that i have created based on the knowledge learned during school time. It is made using basic HTML and some styling.




#About the project:
There is nothing special in the website. The website was created using basic HTML and some styling. I have used marquee property for text or image scrolling which is now depracated and no longer used. It was some created to get familiar with the HTML. As a web Developer enthusiasist, I will be building wonderful projects in future .
